## The minimal implementation of Vue 3 feature

### Why
I've been using Vue 3 for a while now, and I'm quite proficient in its basic usage. However, when encountering bugs and debugging Vue 3's source code, there are times when I find it hard to understand. In order to deepen my understanding of Vue 3, I've implemented a minimal version of Vue.

### Module
